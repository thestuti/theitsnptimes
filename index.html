        IT Students of Nepal (ITSNP) is a community for tech enthusiasts. You may explore and share your knowledge,
        perspectives on anything potentially tech-related in this community. We are a welcoming community for anybody
        interested in technology, whether you are a beginner, experienced, or an expert. You can meet those with similar
        interests here and share your expertise, or just have a chit-chat, or vibe to songs with your online friends. We
        are constantly striving to create a welcoming and warm workplace for the newcomers. Several workshops and sessions
        focused on familiarizing newbies with technology are held on a regular basis, which might help you get started
